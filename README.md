# Cityscapes Transformer Architecture

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer-based model for **semantic segmentation** tasks, specifically designed to process urban scene data
from the **Cityscapes Dataset**. Semantic segmentation enables pixel-level classification of images, making it crucial for applications like autonomous driving 
and urban planning.

## Key Features
- **Transformer-Based Approach**: Harnesses the power of attention mechanisms for accurate segmentation.
- **Cityscapes Dataset Support**: Handles high-resolution images and annotations for urban scene understanding.
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts.
- **Custom Dataset Class**: Efficient loading and handling of image-mask pairs.

## Usage
Refer to the repository for instructions on how to train, evaluate, and deploy the model. Make sure to install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
